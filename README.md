# TKinter RSS Reader for Desktop

1. Made with Tkinter (Python) with vibe coding.
2. Binaries available for Windows.

## Description

This is a simple desktop RSS reader made using TKinter (Python).

It can refresh the feeds periodically. (I set the refresh interval at 30 minutes.)

You can export the news articles, and put them into your newsletter or blog as a reading list.

You can also save the news articles for later.

I was inspired by Cryptopanic.com, which aggregates RSS feeds from many websites.

## Features

1. Can specify your preferred RSS feeds
2. Can specify how many days to keep the feed.
3. Can select news items to export to markdown.
4. Can save selected news items.
5. Can specify refresh interval.
